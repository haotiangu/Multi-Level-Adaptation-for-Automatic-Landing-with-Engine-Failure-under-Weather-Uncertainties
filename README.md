# Multi-Level-Adaptation-for-Automatic-Landing-with-Engine-Failure-under-Weather-Uncertainties
This projects addresses unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation and path planning under engine-out case for landing under severe weather using a Multi-Level Adaptation approach. This is a milestone in a novel autopilot framework, which enables a UAV under large uncertainties to perform safety maneuvers that are traditionally reserved for human pilots with sufficient experience. In addition, we present a high-fidelity simulation environment for fixed-wing aircraft to test and validate the approach under various uncertainties. For the proposed Multi-Level Adaptation autopilot framework, we present the design and analysis as well as the simulation results for the case of emergency landing due to engine failure under severe weather conditions, a challenging task for an autonomous aircraft.
